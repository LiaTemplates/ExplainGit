      <h1>Visualizing Git Concepts with D3</h1>
      <p>
        This website is designed to help you understand some basic git concepts visually.
        This is my first attempt at using both SVG and D3. I hope it is helpful to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adding/staging your files for commit will not be covered by this site. In all sandbox playgrounds
        on this site, just pretend that you always have files staged and ready to commit at all times.
        If you need a refresher on how to add or stage files for commit, please read
        <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository">Git Basics</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sandboxes are split by specific git commands, listed below.

        We are going to skip instructing you on how to add your files for commit in this explanation.
        Let's assume you already know how to do that. If you don't, go read some other tutorials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pretend that you already have your files staged for commit and enter <span class="cmd">git commit</span>
        as many times as you like in the terminal box.

        Creating tags just creates a new tag pointing to the currently checked out commit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tags can be deleted using the command <span class="cmd">git tag -d name</span> (coming soon).

        <span class="cmd">git branch name</span> will create a new branch named "name".
        Creating branches just creates a new tag pointing to the currently checked out commit.

        Branches can be deleted using the command <span class="cmd">git branch -d name</span>.

      <p>
        <span class="cmd">git checkout</span> has many uses,
        but the main one is to switch between branches.</br>
        For example, to switch from master branch to dev branch,
        I would type <span class="cmd">git checkout dev</span>.
        After that, if I do a git commit, notice where it goes. Try it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to checking out branches, you can also checkout individual commits. Try it.</br>
        Make a new commit and then type <span class="cmd">git checkout bb92e0e</span>
        and see what happens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Type <span class="cmd">git commit</span>, <span class="cmd">git branch</span>,
        and <span class="cmd">git checkout</span> commands to your hearts desire
        until you understand this concept.

      <div class="playground-container"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitCheckout-b-Container" class="twelvecol concept-container">
      <p>
        You can combine <span class="cmd">git branch</span> and <span class="cmd">git checkout</span>
        into a single command by typing <span class="cmd">git checkout -b branchname</span>.
        This will create the branch if it does not already exist and immediately check it out.
      </p>
      <div class="playground-container"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitReset-Container" class="twelvecol concept-container">
      <p>
        <span class="cmd">git reset</span> will move HEAD and the current branch back to wherever
        you specify, abandoning any commits that may be left behind. This is useful to undo a commit
        that you no longer need.
      </p>
      <p>
        This command is normally used with one of three flags: "--soft", "--mixed", and "--hard".
        The soft and mixed flags deal with what to do with the work that was inside the commit after
        you reset, and you can read about it <a href="http://git-scm.com/2011/07/11/reset.html">here</a>.
        Since this visualization cannot graphically display that work, only the "--hard" flag will work
        on this site.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ref "HEAD^" is usually used together with this command. "HEAD^" means "the commit right
        before HEAD. "HEAD^^" means "two commits before HEAD", and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that you must <b>never</b> use <span class="cmd">git reset</span> to abandon commits
        that have already been pushed and merged into the origin. This can cause your local repository
        to become out of sync with the origin. Don't do it unless you really know what you're doing.
      </p>
      <div class="playground-container"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitRevert-Container" class="twelvecol concept-container">
      <p>
        To undo commits that have already been pushed and shared with the team, we cannot use the
        <span class="cmd">git reset</span> command. Instead, we have to use <span class="cmd">git revert</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="cmd">git revert</span> will create a new commit that will undo all of the work that
        was done in the commit you want to revert.
      </p>
      <div class="playground-container"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitMerge-Container" class="twelvecol concept-container">
      <p>
        <span class="cmd">git merge</span> will create a new commit with two parents. The resulting
        commit snapshot will have the all of the work that has been done in both branches.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there was no divergence between the two commits, git will do a "fast-forward" method merge.</br>
        To see this happen, checkout the 'ff' branch and then type <span class="cmd">git merge dev</span>.
      </p>
      <div class="playground-container"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitRebase-Container" class="twelvecol concept-container">
      <p>
        <span class="cmd">git rebase</span> will take the commits on this branch and "move" them so that their
        new "base" is at the point you specify.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should pay close attention to the commit IDs of the circles as they move when you do this exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason I put "move" in quotations because this process actually generates brand new commits with
        completely different IDs than the old commits, and leaves the old commits where they were. For this reason,
        you never want to rebase commits that have already been shared with the team you are working with.
      </p>
      <div class="playground-container"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitFetch-Container" class="twelvecol concept-container">
      <p>
        <span class="cmd">git fetch</span> will update all of the "remote tracking branches" in your local repository.
        Remote tracking branches are tagged in grey.
      </p>
      <div class="playground-container"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitPull-Container" class="twelvecol concept-container">
      <p>
        A <span class="cmd">git pull</span> is a two step process that first does a <span class="cmd">git fetch</span>,
        and then does a <span class="cmd">git merge</span> of the remote tracking branch associated with your current branch.
        If you have no current branch, the process will stop after fetching.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the argument "--rebase" was given by typing <span class="cmd">git pull --rebase</span>, the second step of
        pull process will be a rebase instead of a merge. This can be set to the default behavior by configuration by typing:
        <span class="cmd">git config branch.BRANCHNAME.rebase true</span>.
      </p>
      <div class="playground-container"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitPush-Container" class="twelvecol concept-container">
      <p>
        A <span class="cmd">git push</span> will find the commits you have on your local branch that the corresponding branch
        on the origin server does not have, and send them to the remote repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        By default, all pushes must cause a fast-forward merge on the remote repository. If there is any divergence between
        your local branch and the remote branch, your push will be rejected. In this scenario, you need to pull first and then
        you will be able to push again.
      </p>
      <div class="playground-container"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitClean-Container" class="twelvecol concept-container">
      <p>
        One simple example of the use of <span class="cmd">git reset</span> is to completely restore your local repository
        state to that of the origin.</br>
        You can do so by typing <span class="cmd">git reset origin/master</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that this won't delete untracked files, you will have to delete those separately with
        the command <span class="cmd">git clean -df</span>.

        Below is a situation in which you are working in a local branch that is all your own. You want to receive the latest code
        from the origin server's master branch. To update your local branch, you can do it without having to switch branches!
      </p>
      <p>
        First do a <span class="cmd">git fetch</span>, then type <span class="cmd">git rebase origin/master</span>!
